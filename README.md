### Short Project Overview
This project involves building a device that can measure temperature and humidity levels. The device will be created using various sensors and a microcontroller, and it will transmit data to a platform for monitoring and analysis. 

### Estimated Time
Approximate time to complete: [Insert time here]

## Objective
### Why You Chose the Project
I chose this project because it offers practical insights into IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor technology. 

### What Purpose Does it Serve
The device can be used for environmental monitoring, helping to maintain optimal conditions in various settings, such as homes, greenhouses, and data centers.

### What Insights You Think it Will Give
By collecting data on temperature and humidity, the project will provide insights into environmental patterns and help in understanding how these factors vary over time.

## Material
### List of Material
- [Sensor 1] - Specifications: [specifications]
- [Sensor 2] - Specifications: [specifications]
- Wires
- Microcontroller (e.g., Pycom LoPy4)
- [Other components]

### Specifications and Cost
- **Sensor 1:** Measures temperature; bought from [Store], cost: [Cost]
- **Sensor 2:** Measures humidity; bought from [Store], cost: [Cost]
